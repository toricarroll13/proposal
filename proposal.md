# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Choose your own Adventure Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It's a choose your own Adventure game which gives the user a simulation in which they're able to choose objects to help them survive/move on and take different routes to get to the end goal.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?


The software will include a lot of input from the users so that the user is given some freedom to their decisions/choices. It will also include a lot of for loops and nested loops to account for the different possibilities and outcomes of the users decisions. There will be different paths to choose from as the user furthers into the simulations and depending on what the user chooses it will allow them to continue on or it will kill them/the simulation



## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will accomplish the main course in the choose your adventure game and allow for the basic outcomes.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We will create extra routes/scenarios to take to get to the end goal. We will also include extra code that will help prevent the code from crashing from technical errors or syntax errors caused from the user.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If the user dies/picks the wrong choice, we will give them the option to retrieve themselves or restart the simulation rather than the code crashing and having to start it back up again.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Since our project will mainly include functions, if else statements, for loops and nested for loops, we won't need to do a lost of research. If anything we will need to go back to those lessons and make sure we know how to use those functions correctly. Between my and my partner, we will split up the work in creating the different sections/scenarios.
